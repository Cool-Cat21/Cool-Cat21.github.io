        <h2>Where is it at?</h2> 
        <p> <strong>The Great Plains</strong> are located west<br> of the <strong>Mississippi River</strong> and east of the <strong>Rocky<br> Mountains</strong>. You can find them from <em>Texas</em> all the way up to <em>North Dakota</em>.<br> Here is a list of some other states that have the Great Plains.</p>

        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>The Great Plains consists of a large area of<br> <em>flatland</em> that extends for miles and hardly any trees are to be<br> seen. There is mostly prairie, steppe, and grassland in<br> the Great Plains. You can find animals like <em>bison</em> and <em>pronghorn</em> in the area.<br> Some other animals that can be found are...</p>

        <h2>Personal Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Some people may think that the Great Plains is<br> boring because there's nothing to see...and that's true.<br> However, I believe that it would be amazing to be able to<br> visit the Great Plains to see all the animals and see the<br> starry sky at night. Plus, I just want to be able to go there<br> to sit somewhere in the plains and just chill.</p>
